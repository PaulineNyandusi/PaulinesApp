App Idea: A mental Health App
I want to make a personalized AI-driven mental health app** designed to help users manage stress, anxiety, and overall mental well-being. 
It will be able to track the users moods. It will also intergrate cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, and real-time emotional support tools
to create a highly adaptive self-care experience.
